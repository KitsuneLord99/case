The Switch Lite lacks detachable Joy-Cons and can't be docked into a TV, thus making it more suitable for play on the go and also serves as a more affordable option to gaming consumers. The console was announced in a trailer by Yoshiaki Koizumi on July 10th, 2019 before being released a couple of months later. It is available in an exotic range of yellow, turquoise, grey, and coral paint jobs, and is marketed at $200 dollars or the regional equivalent. On May 21, 2021, Nintendo released the blue variety of color for the system.",

Despite this classification, Nintendo markets the system mostly as a home console that can be played on the go rather than a dedicated portable handheld system.[6] It was officially announced on October 20, 2016[7] and was released simultaneously on March 3, 2017 in America, Japan, Europe, Hong Kong, and other territories.[8] It costs US $299.99 in America and JP ï¿½29,980 in Japan. A Nintendo Switch presentation containing more information about the system was live-streamed from January 12, 2017 at 11:00 PM to January 13, 2017 at 12:05 AM (EST).[9] The Nintendo Switch had a hands-on event on six separate Sundays in six different cities across America prior to its release date,[10] along with Tokyo Big Sight, Japan. Pre-order retail reservations started on January 21, 2017 in Japan. As of January 12, 2017, 50 companies have collaborated with Nintendo and 80 games are currently in development for the Nintendo Switch. On January 4, 2018, Nintendo announced that the Nintendo Switch had sold over ten million units and became the fastest-selling video game console in America within a time frame of the first ten months.[11] During the reveal of their partnership with DeNA, Satoru Iwata revealed the new console. The Nintendo Switch is a portable system which can be docked for home play, effectively hybridizing home consoles and handhelds.",

In March 2015, the FCC lifted its information embargo regarding regulation details performed in September 2014 on the standard model, suggesting Nintendo of America did indeed consider releasing the standard model at one point.
